A simple Flutter application showcasing the flutter_dynamic_icon package for implementing dynamic app launcher icons for iOS. Created for 
[this Medium blog](https://medium.com/@jauntybrain/dynamic-app-icons-in-flutter-ultimate-guide-f67f63681b40).


# Installation

Clone the repository and run the application. 

Make sure to remove the AppIcons directory (located in the Runner), place it outside of the "ios" folder, and manually add it to XCode (inside the Runner folder) by drag-and-dropping and choosing the "Create groups" option. Otherwise, the app will error when uploading to AppStore.
