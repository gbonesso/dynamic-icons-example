# Flutter Dynamic Icons Example

A simple Flutter application showcasing the flutter_dynamic_icon package for implementing dynamic app launcher icons for iOS. Created for this Medium blog. 

# Installation

Clone the repository and run. Make sure to remove the AppIcons directory (located in the Runner), place it outside of the "ios" folder and manually add it to XCode (inside the Runner folder) by drag-and-dropping and choosing "Create groups" option. Otherwise, the app will error out when uploading to AppStore.
